## Hi there! 👋

I'm Luke, a 5th-year student completing the Computer Science and Economics Double Major program at Wilfrid Laurier University. I have a passion for software engineering and I dream of designing and building applications that will make the world a better place. I love a good challenge and am always looking for opportunities to further refine my craft and learn new things, usually through hackathons, competitive programming competitions, and side projects.
